              I am a passionate young individual whose goal is to provide more
              employment opportunities to the people of Pakistan as well as
              educate them about technology and design. I want to change things;
              show people that technology & design isnâ€™t just limited to
              software development & graphic design. People need to be educated
              on how these skills can help them make better decisions in their
              personal lives and careers.
